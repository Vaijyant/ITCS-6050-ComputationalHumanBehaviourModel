### About
Course project repository for Computational Human Behaviour Model. Fall 2017.

Detected human emotion from human speech, in the English language, by extracting acoustic features with an AUC of 75.78%. Implement classification models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Means clustering, and Neural Network along with tuning the hyperparameters for the algorithms. Preprocessed data to remove meta data associated with the audio *.wav files.
